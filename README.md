# 🌞 SolarShare – Community-Powered Solar Energy Grid with Hedera Micropayments

## 🚀 Project Overview

SolarShare is a **community-powered decentralized energy platform** designed to solve Nigeria’s persistent electricity challenges.
By leveraging **Hedera Hashgraph micropayments** and **DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks)** principles, SolarShare allows households and businesses to **buy, share, and trade solar energy** seamlessly.

💡 Think _Airbnb for solar energy_ – but powered by blockchain.

## 🎯 Hackathon Track Alignment

-   **Primary Track:** AI & DePIN – decentralized physical energy infrastructure with smart micropayments.
-   **Secondary Track:** DLT for Operations – sustainability, efficiency, and eco-friendly energy management.

---

## 🔧 Features

✅ **Decentralized Solar Grid** – households with excess solar sell directly to neighbors.
✅ **Hedera Micropayments** – pay-per-use, real-time energy credits with $HBAR.
✅ **Energy Tokenization** – 1 kWh = 1 token for easy exchange & governance.
✅ **Mobile-first Access** – designed for accessibility in rural & urban Nigeria.
✅ **Transparent Records** – immutable ledger for transactions and usage data.
